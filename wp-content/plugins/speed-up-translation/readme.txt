The translations reduces speed of Wordpress. This plugin offers a caching solution that reduces this effects on performance.

== Description ==

The translations reduces speed of Wordpress.

For localized WordPress the loading time of translation files accounts for 30% of the entire processing time (less or more 40 milliseconds per page).

For each translation file, WordPress unpacks it and then everyone will be converted in an "Translation_Entry" object. This process, repeated at each page view, is a waste time and resource.

You can make this process 3 times faster by just installing this plugin. This plugin offers a caching solution using the WordPress standard cache mechanism that reduces this effects on performance.

Configurations are not required! You just have to install it and after the plugin does it all, none further action it's required.

This plugin is very light: only 5 kB.

== Features ==

* No configuration
* Supports multiple languages
* Supports plugin's translation files caching
* Supports WordPress Network/Multisite installation
* Cache automatically expire when translation file is updated

== Installation ==

1. Upload the complete `speed-up-translation` folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress

== Recommended Installation ==

For better performance, verify that `/wp-content/object-cache.php` is installed (see https://codex.wordpress.org/Class_Reference/WP_Object_Cache#Persistent_Cache_Plugins).
